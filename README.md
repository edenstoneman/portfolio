# portfolio
This portfolio will serve as a central hub for all my projects. The construction of this site will run parallel to the activities of other projects and their case studies. While the site will initially be hosted on GitHub, the code will be fully interactive and responsiveâ€”primed for domain name assignment.

The purpose of this site is to showcase my identity as a designer, my prior work, and my potential. Although it will eventually include all my projects, the current minimum viable product (MVP) features an "About me" section, contact details, and three UI/UX projects: Lingo Curve, Noon Sigma, and 4Life Advertiser. Each of these projects will be presented as case studies. While my goal is to have interactive, coded pages for these projects, I am also content with displaying Figma screenshots.

Each project will include an encompassing case study that presents the entire design process. I aim to maintain consistency across all projects to clearly demonstrate my process. I selected these specific projects as they highlight various aspects of my design capabilities. For instance:

- Lingo Curve showcases my empathy for the user and research skills.
- Noon Sigma manifests my creativity and design skills.
- 4Life Advertiser exemplifies my proficiency in developing a design system and user journeys.
